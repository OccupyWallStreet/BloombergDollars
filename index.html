    <h3>This week, NYC Mayor Mike made headlines with a donation of $250,000 to Planned Parenthood.  $250,000 is a lot of money for Planned Parenthood, but for a guy who's worth about $19 billion, how much is it worth to him?  Let's do a little math and see...</h3>

    <h3 >With a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/lists/2009/54/rich-list-09_Michael-Bloomberg_C610.html" target="_blank">net worth</a> around 19 billion dollars, Bloomberg is America's wealthiest politician and one of the wealthiest people in America, ranked as high as #8 in recent years.  The <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/news/assets_c/2011/08/WealthChart-6092.html">median net worth</a> (income, property, investments) of an American family on the other hand is about $96,000.</h3> 
    <h2 id="eight">That's a ratio of 197,916 to 1.</h2>
    <h3>So something that would be worth "a dollar" to Mike Bloomberg would be worth about $200,000 to you. </h3> 
    <h3>What does it even mean look like be 200,000 wealthier than the average American family? Here's how many hundred dollar bills you'd need to equal one Bloomberg Buck.</h3>

    </div>
    
    <h3>A  house in Park Slope, worth about 2.5 million American dollars, would cost about $12.50 in Bloomberg Bucks.</h3>  
    <h3>An <a href="http://www.yale.edu/printer/bulletin/htmlfiles/art/tuition-fees-general-expenses.html">Ivy League education</a> could be paid for with about 60 Bloomberg cents.  
      <h3>A new laptop, worth about $2,000 could be purchased for a Bloomberg Penny. </h3>
      <h3>Loaning your friend $5 isn't a big deal, and if you had Bloomberg Bucks, that five-spot would be like loaning a friend $2,000,000.</h3>  
    <h3>See where we're going with this?  Mike Bloomberg donating $250,000 to Planned Parenthood for breast cancer screening would be like you donating about 1 dollar and 63 cents - literally pocket change.  It's not nothing, but it's not exactly front-page news.  Which leads us to ask, why not just donate the full <i>Three Bloomberg Bucks</i> and pay off all of the money that Planned Parenthood is going to lose from the Komen Foundation? Why, if providing breast cancer screening for every American only costs us about $30 per year, are we even having trouble coming up with the money at all?</h3>
